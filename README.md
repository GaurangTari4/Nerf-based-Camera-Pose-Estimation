# Nerf-based Camera Pose Estimation

Welcome to the Nerf-based Camera Pose Estimation repository! This repository is dedicated to providing tools and implementations related to camera pose estimation using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF).


## Repository Contents

- **camera.py**: This script is designed to extract camera intrinsic parameters and save them in an `.npz` format.

- **tiny_nerf.ipynb**: Contains the Tiny NeRF implementation integrated with a pose estimation pipeline.

- **modified_nerf.ipynb**: An enhanced version of the Tiny NeRF implementation. This script introduces:
  - Hierarchical Sampling
  - Stratified Sampling
  - Tone Mapping
